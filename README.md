Reddit Clone
===========
 Pythreddit
----------
Pythreddit will be a reddit-like clone. 

This was built to explore my knowledge of databases, apis, Python and assess my ability to create a web app from the ground up.

This app aims to be a news/social network where users can sign up, browse many different topics and share their 
own opinions. Users can interact with one another through comments.
