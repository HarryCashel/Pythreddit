Pythreddit
----------
Pythreddit will be a reddit-like clone. 

This was built to explore my knowledge of databases, apis, Python and assess my ability to create a web app from the ground up.

This app aims to be a news/social network where users can sign up, browse many different topics and share their 
own opinions. Users can interact with one another through comments. Users may fill their profile with information and set a profile photo.
